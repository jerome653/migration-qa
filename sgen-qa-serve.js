// sgen qa-serve — local web UI for the SGEN Site QA suite. FOUR independent tools, one browser app,
// bound to 127.0.0.1 only. No AI at runtime; no fake results. Every button POSTs to the SAME frozen
// engines the CLIs use — this file is UI-exposure ONLY and modifies none of them:
//
// ONE EXCEPTION, stated rather than buried: the per-tool settings popup's scope control needs the
// scorer to be able to score a SUBSET of the registry, which the frozen engines could not express.
// score.js therefore gained an opt-in `compute(suites, {excludeRules})` and report.js an opt-in
// `opts.scopePanel` slot. Both default to the previous behaviour exactly (no opts => byte-identical
// output => the CLIs and every existing caller are unchanged). Scope is a SCORING decision only:
// this file never asks the engine to skip a check, so findings/evidence/tally/verdict/readiness stay
// whole-site and a de-scoped run still reports every problem it found.

// which numbers are scoped and which are not. Fail closed, disclose always.

     Measured 2026-07-16 (Site Audit tab, 1440x900): body/html were both sized to CONTENT (624px) in a
     900px window with min-height:0 and html's background TRANSPARENT — so the bottom 276px was dark
     only because CSS propagates body's background to the canvas when html has none. That propagation
     is a fallback, not a decision: any moment it does not apply (first paint before body renders,
     print/PDF, the Electron window's own default surface) the same 276px comes back WHITE. That is
     the "black or white gap" — one cause, two colours, depending on who paints the canvas.
     Setting the background on html makes the root itself the painter (no propagation involved), and

  /* ---- controls the per-tool settings popup owns ---------------------------------------------
     HIDDEN, NOT DELETED — deliberately. Read this before you "clean up" the markup below it.
     Each control tagged .settings-owned is STILL the one source of truth the runner reads at run
     time — runAudit() reads $('a-max') / $('a-render') / #a-vps, runVisual() reads $('v-mode') /
     $('v-scope') / $('v-max') / $('v-warm') / #v-vps, runCert() reads $('c-sitemap') / $('c-visual')
     / $('c-prod') / $('c-max') — and the settings popup is a second VIEW bound to these same nodes
     (FIELDS[].bind + fGet/fSet, and FACTORY, which snapshots the authored DOM at parse time).
     display:none changes none of that: .value, .checked and querySelectorAll all still work on a
     hidden node. Delete these inputs and you break BOTH the scan AND the popup that edits them.
     The dashboard therefore shows only the per-run inputs (the URLs, the save-as name) + the gear
     + the run button; everything that is a SETTING is edited in the popup. */
  /* !important is deliberate. This class means "this control now lives in the settings popup; never
     render it on the dashboard" — an absolute rule, not a suggestion. Without it the class silently
     loses: label.fld{display:flex} above is specificity 0-1-1 and beats a bare .settings-owned (0-1-0)
     no matter what order they appear in, so the Save-as-reference label kept rendering at full width
     while every class-matched group hid correctly. Anything tagged settings-owned must stay in the DOM

          <!-- "Save report as" now lives in the Site Audit settings popup as a perRun field, so the
               dashboard is URL + gear + Audit like every other tool. It is HIDDEN, not deleted: runAudit()
               reads #a-save straight from this node and the popup binds to it.
               It is per-RUN, never a default, and runAudit() CLEARS it once a scan consumes it. That is
               load-bearing, not tidiness: saveBaseline() (compare.js) is an unconditional writeFileSync
               over baselines/<name>.json — no existence check, no versioning. A remembered name silently
               re-points the reference at whatever you scanned next: save "live", scan staging, and the
               "live" baseline IS staging, so Visual Comparison diffs staging against itself and reports a
               false all-clear. The old sticky localStorage entry did exactly that; it was survivable only
               because the field was visible. Hidden + sticky would have made it silent, so the stickiness
               had to go with the visibility. -->

    // ================= PER-TOOL SETTINGS =========================================================
    // A gear on each of the 4 tools opens THIS tool's settings. Three rules hold the design together:
    //
    //  1. ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Every field either BINDS to the real control the runner already reads
    //     (a-max, a-render, a-vps, v-scope, ...) or has no DOM twin at all (scope, reports.limit).
    //     The popup is a second VIEW of that control, never a second copy of the value — so wiring the
    //     popup cannot desync from what /api/run actually receives. It also means the run path below
    //     is untouched: runAudit() still reads $('a-max'), exactly as it did before this existed.
    //  2. FACTORY IS THE AUTHORED DOM, snapshotted at parse time before any restore runs. "Reset
    //     defaults" therefore restores what the build literally ships with — it cannot drift from the
    //     HTML the way a hand-maintained defaults table would.
    //  3. TWO SLOTS, NO MAGIC. Saved default (server, NOTES_DIR/settings.json) or FACTORY. Changing a
    //     field affects this session; it persists when you click Save as default. No hidden auto-stick.
